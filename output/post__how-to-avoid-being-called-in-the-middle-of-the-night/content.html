If you run a 24/7 business then that may not be an issue but if you want to avoid getting calls on your mobile or your home landline in the early hours then you may want to log into your dmClubhouse and set up your company opening hours. <!--more-->



You set up company opening hours as part of a call plan – a standard feature of dmConnect12 and dmSwitchboard12. You then have three options as to what happens to a call when your company is closed: you can let calls just hang up, go to voicemail,  or to dmAnswers14, our professional call answering service.



This is what the default company opening hours will look like in your dmClubhouse:

Add your company name, click on the days you are not open, and then set up your hours of business. Here is an example of what a completed one looks like:

Then click on the People tab and select advanced options to say what you want to have happen when your company is closed.

Your changes will be saved into a new plan and once activated your changes will be live!



You can also create different plans for holidays like Christmas and Easter. As soon as the holidays are over it will just take a minute to re-activate your standard plan.
