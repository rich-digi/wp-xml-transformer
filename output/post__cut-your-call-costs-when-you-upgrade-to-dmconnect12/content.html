It’s free to upgrade if you have a dmConnect geographical number<!--more--></h4>

<h2>Here are some of the ways you can save money</h2>

<strong>Lower call forwarding costs: </strong>Calls forwarded to mobile phones cost 10 pence per minute with dmConnect – we have managed to cut them to 8 pence per minute with our dmConnect12 service. It costs nothing to upgrade, so if you frequently forward calls to your mobile phone it is well worth upgrading. Calls forwarded to an international number are also cheaper.



<strong>Receive calls for free when you use our VOIP service: </strong>dmConnect12 comes with a VOIP option and calls answered using this service are totally free! You can set your service so that it first tries to connect to you on VOIP, before forwarding to your mobile.



<strong>No charge on calls that go to voicemail: </strong>dmConnect12 comes with its own voicemail and calls that use this service have no call forwarding costs and the voicemail is sent to you immediately via email.



<strong>Save money by using plans: </strong>Calls forwarded to a land-line are significantly cheaper than those forwarded to a mobile. With dmConnect12, changing your call forwarding details now takes less than a minute. You can now save different settings into different plans and switch your call forwarding to a land-line when one is available.



<strong>Use your number to make outgoing calls: </strong>You can use your dmConnect12 number to make outgoing calls through our VOIP service, a mobile or land-line. Your dmConnect12 number will show as the caller identification number and you will benefit from our low tariffs.



<strong>Save money when making calls from overseas: </strong>Making calls from your mobile or hotel room while abroad can be expensive.  With dmConnect12 you can save money by connecting to your hotel wifi and benefiting from the same low tariffs that you would in the UK.
