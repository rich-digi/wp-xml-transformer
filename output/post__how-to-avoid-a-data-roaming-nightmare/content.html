Maybe you’ve been one of them!</h4>

Whether it is with family, friends or for business, we often need to keep in touch whilst away. But how can we do this without being fleeced by exorbitant international rates?<!--more-->



Here are our tips for keeping your mobile phone bills to a minimum while you are out of the UK.

<h3>Tips to keep down costs</h3>

<ul>

	<li><strong>Buy a local SIM</strong> or a specialist travelling SIM and pop it into an old phone. A local SIM can probably provide data access at a much cheaper rate than your roaming SIM</li>

	<li><strong>Look out for Wi-Fi</strong> either in your hotel or your overseas office - you can make and receive calls using a VOIP application</li>

	<li><strong>For dmClub members </strong>consider diverting your main phone to your dmClub dmConnect12 number, or a dmSwitchboard12 DDI to your personal extension. This can then be forwarded to a local SIM, which will not expose you to the roaming charges</li>

</ul>

We hope you find these ideas useful.



Happy travelling!
