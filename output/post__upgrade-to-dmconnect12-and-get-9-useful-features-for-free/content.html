<h4>If you have a dmConnect service with a geographical number, you can take advantage of a free upgrade to dmConnect12, and start enjoying these great features <!--more--></h4>

<h2>A virtual business line</h2>

dmConnect12 is more than just a number – it is now a fully functional business line. The only extra cost will be for your outbound calls which will be at our low-cost tariffs.

<h2><strong>Anytalk</strong></h2>

You can literally make calls on your dmConnect12 number from anywhere- even abroad! Our VOIP service is ideal when you have an internet connection and dmConnect12 is so flexible that you can use any phone line to make a call via your dmConnect12 business number.

<h2>Voicemail</h2>

Save money on missed calls by using our built-in voicemail and immediately get the message forwarded via email.

<h2><strong>Professional call answering</strong></h2>

We now have a flexible and affordable professional call answering service built into dmConnect12, available on a pay-as-you-go basis. Get your calls answered in your company name and according to your instructions. You can use this service as an alternative to voicemail or have us answer your calls for you when you are too busy to answer them yourself.

<h2>Adjustable company opening hours</h2>

You can set your company business hours so that out-of-hours callers get a message and are directed to voicemail or our call answering service.

<h2>Plans</h2>

You can different settings into different plans. For example, you could have one setting for when you are on holiday and another for when you are out of the office. It takes less than a minute to switch from one plan to another.

<h2>Call phasing</h2>

You can set incoming calls to go through to VOIP first, before forwarding the call to your mobile. This can save you money because calls received via VOIP do not bear call forwarding costs.

<h2>Three-way conferencing</h2>

Sometimes it is useful to bring someone else into a conversation. You can do this with dmConnect12’s 3 way conferencing feature.
