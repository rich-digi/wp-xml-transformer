As your first point of contact, he tackles those pesky problems with the same kind of dedication that he puts into every big run.<!--more-->



After travelling around the world, Rumel made his home with us four years ago. Since then, he’s helped our customers resolve all sorts of concerns.

“Most of the the things our customers get in touch about can be taken care of in no time, like adding funds to their account, but some issues do need extra legwork,” he says.



“The complicated problems give me a chance to learn a lot more and find new ways to improve the service for our customers, as well knowing just what to do if the same thing happens again.



“Telephone numbers can mean so much more to someone running a business, so I’m glad when I can help them solve any problems as quickly as possible.”

<blockquote>For Rumel, its a thrill on par with completing his first marathon, a 26-mile slog around Amsterdam, which he says was “the best experience of my life.”</blockquote>

After a rewarding day on the front line, you’ll find fun-loving Rumel tearing up the dancefloor at a club or gig.



“I like to get away from life and have fun,” he tells us. “I  get away a couple of times a year, but I won’t be setting off on any round-the-world trips again any time soon. After all, I’ve got dmClub customers to help.”
