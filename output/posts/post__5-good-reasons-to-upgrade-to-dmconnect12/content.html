<h2>Make outbound calls using your dmConnect number</h2>

With dmConnect12 you can now make outbound calls from your mobile or our VOIP service and have your dmConnect number show as the caller identification number. This is useful if you want people to call you back on your dmConnect number rather than your mobile number. Its a better option than withholding your caller identification number because more people will answer your calls.

<h2>Call alerts</h2>

When you receive a dmConnect call on your mobile it is good for your business to be able to answer in your company name. dmConnect12 has a feature called Call Whisper which alertsyou that you have a dmConnect12 call for your company. This will enable you to differentiate between personal and business calls. If you have more than one company, you can now have all your dmConnect calls come through to the same phone.

<h2>Save multiple forwarding numbers</h2>

dmConnect12 includes a feature called Plans which enables you to pre-save settings, allowing you to quickly change your call forwarding number. As forwarding to a landline is much cheaper than forwarding to a mobile you can set up plans for different landline numbers when available and switch back to your mobile when they are not. Changing a plan takes less than a minute.
