Jon is an expert on our switchboard products, in particular, dmConnect12 and dmSwitchboard12. Highly skilled at asking the right questions, Jon always aims <!--more-->to find out how you operate, how you like your business calls answered and recommending the right product and service for you. Because Jon speaks to so many different customers, he is often able to make recommendations for any specific business requirements you may have based on what similar businesses are doing.



In addition, because he is at the front line and speaking to dmClub members every day, Jon gets to hear about other services or product ideas that you might like or need  these are fed back to the product development team on your behalf. A great example of this is dmAnswers14: a deluge of requests from our members for a 'pay-as-you-go' human answering service led to the development and launch of our new dmAnswers14 service.



In his spare time Jon likes to play golf. If you ask him what his handicap is hell reply, "A bad swing and no skill!"
