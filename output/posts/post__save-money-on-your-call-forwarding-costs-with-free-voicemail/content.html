If you have your calls forwarded to your mobile phone then it will incur a call forwarding cost when you answer the call. Ifthe call goes to voicemail on your mobile phone then unfortunately you will still incur a call forwarding cost. However, if you use dmClubs freevoicemail service thenthe call will be free! Whats more, your voicemail will immediately be forwarded to your email account.



To force missed calls to go to dmClubs voicemail you need to go into your advanced switchboard settings and select the Whisper+1 option. dmConnect12 is a personal switchboard and has most of the functionality of our dmSwitchboard12 product. You can learn about Whisper+1 and other advanced settings on <a href="http://notes.dmclub.net/5022">dmNote #5022</a>. If you get stuck then give support a call.
