As you know, our innovative techies in the lab are rather proud of their world firsts. Now that we have launched dmAnswers14, their attention has already turned to two more things customers have been asking for:

<ul>

	<li>Call recording</li>

	<li>More payment options</li>

</ul>

<!--more-->

<h2>Call recording</h2>

We want to do a little more than simply record calls – <strong>dmConnect12</strong> and <strong>dmSwitchboard12</strong> have actually been capable of call recording for some time already. The real challenge is around how to store those calls once the service is switched on and, more importantly, how you can quickly retrieve and replay calls. This has got the creative juices flowing in the lab and you can be sure they will come up with something that is not only ground breaking, but will also herald a new age of efficiency for your business.

<h2>Payment options</h2>

A little less exciting but just as important, according to your feedback, is payment options. Currently you can make auto-top-ups but we are looking to expand the payment options even further, making your life even easier.  One customer has challenged our techies to find a way for them never to have to log in to their clubhouse ever again!
