On 13<sup>th</sup> June, 2014 the Consumer Rights Directive became law – including legislation relating to consumer service calls – like when you want to complain to a mail order company about a faulty item.<!--more-->



Using telephone numbers that charge above the basic rate for such service calls will fall foul of the legislation. Examples of such numbers include 0844, 0845, and 0871 numbers. We are in a mobile economy and these numbers incur excessive charges from mobile phone companies. Numbers that start with 01, 02, and 03 etc and mobile phone numbers are effectively free-to-caller from fixed and mobile phones because they are included in contract allowances.

<h3>Know your rights</h3>

The  Consumer Rights Directive only applies to B2C customers and not B2B. However, there is a wider issue with the use of 0844, 0845, and 0871 numbers as a main number for a business. People typically hate calling such numbers from their mobile phones – charges can be as high as 40 pence per minute or even higher. If your competitors have normal geographical numbers and you do not then there is a risk you will get fewer enquiries.



If you are using such numbers for your business, maybe now is a good time to switch to a geographical number?
