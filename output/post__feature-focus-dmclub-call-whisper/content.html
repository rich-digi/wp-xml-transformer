Every day, you have the challenge of building on your success, keeping the profits coming in and juggling your home life and family alongside it.</h4>

Many business owners work multiple jobs, and we all have to squeeze work in around our social lives. Answering the phone appropriately is a challenge. While redirecting business calls to your mobile helps you keep those plates spinning, how can you tell whether the incoming call is from a client, or the mechanic that’s looking at your car today?



<strong>Call Whisper </strong>is a dmClub service that gives you a vital hint as to the nature of the incoming call.



When you receive a call, our service will play an automated message telling you the origin of the call. You can have a number for each of your businesses, all coming through to your mobile, and Call Whisper will tell you who the caller is ringing.



That means you can answer the phone professionally when you need to, but leaves you free to enjoy using your mobile for personal calls too. It’s such a simple idea, and it’s a feature that you won’t be able to live without once you’ve tried it.

<h2>How Call Whisper Works</h2>

Call Whisper works with dmConnect12 and dmSwitchboard12 and meshes seamlessly with the call forwarding service. When a call is pushed to your mobile, Call Whisper kicks in.



This vital hint is the key to answering calls professionally. It ensures that:

<ul>

	<li>Customers are never confused into thinking they dialled the wrong number</li>

	<li>You know what tone to adopt when you answer every call</li>

	<li>There’s no need to worry about mixing up your businesses</li>

	<li>The days of carrying multiple mobiles are long gone</li>

	<li>Callers assume you’re in the office, and get a more professional impression</li>

	<li>New customers feel confident in your professionalism</li>

</ul>

Call Whisper works with landlines too. Just forward your calls and hear it in action.
