If you have a dmClub product with voicemail, then your answer should be a resounding "Yes!"</h4>

dmClub has re-engineered how voicemail works - from the modern day equivalent of an answering machine to something a lot more useful to a modern small business.<!--more-->



What's different about dmClub's voicemail is that once a voice message has been left for you, it is immediately forwarded to your email inbox. This has a number of business benefits over the traditional method of calling up a central voicemail system for your messages:

<ul>

	<li>As voicemails are delivered as an email attachment, it is easy to forward your voicemails to one or more people</li>

	<li>You can delegate review of your voicemail messages by setting up your voicemails to go to your personal assistant</li>

	<li>You can keep a permanent record of a voicemail message by filing your messages</li>

	<li>You can avoid data roaming charges when picking up your voicemails while abroad</li>

</ul>

Once you have tried dmClub's voicemail product, you will never want to go back to old fashioned voicemail retrieval.



If your current dmClub product does not include voicemail, you may be eligible for a free upgrade. Why not give support a call?
